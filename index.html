	<h2>Life of a Starfish</h2>
  <img id= small src="images/starfish-2.jpg" alt="small image">
		<p>Starfish live at sea. They do not have skeletons. They can reproduce both sexually and asexually. 
      They eat clams, mussels, and oysters. 
      Knowledge is everything you can learn, be that from an academical environment or through general experience. 
      Effort is trying your best. Outcome equals to result or consequence. 
      In order to achieve "outcome" you need "effort", and without knowledge all that is hollow.
      Understanding that efforts made without knowledge will bring you wothless outcomes makes entrepreneurs better prepared for life and challenges, which sets them for success. As a student it is valuable to be aware of this connection and apply it generously for assured success. Now is the best time to use as an example of a disconnection between knowledge, effort, and outcome. When preparing to study in Canada, my efforts were great, but the general knowledge (about the country, about the course/school I chose, and so on) was lacking, which led to an underwhelming outcome (so far). 
      At the time, my mindset was positive. 
      I was excited for a great opportunity and a new chapter in my life (the outcome discrepancy only presented itself later).</p>
